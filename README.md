# Twelin

This is the result of my internship at the [LCPMR](https://lcpmr.cnrs.fr/)
from May to Jully 2022.

The goal is to predict the energy of **TW**o **EL**ectronic **IN**tegrals using
Marchine Learning more particularly Neural Network.

Due to the nature of two electronic integrals, we need to develop methods to face
two majors issue :
- the size of the training set
- the over representation of near zeros values in the dataset

This project contains :
- DATA :

    This library is a set of tools that deals with the dataset
    and the training.
- test :

    A series
